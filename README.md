# Twitter-Geolocation-
The project makes some analysis on the twitter data of @Rbloggers and plot geolocation of it's followers using twitter API and R studio.
It contains three Rscript files, three data sets and one final report of the project.
The three Rscript files are "Set up and data mining", "Plot maps" and "Data Analysis". If you want to reproduce my work, you can just run the "Plot maps" and "Data Analysis" file since the data set that I retreive using "Set up and data mining" are also here to read directly.
